While network science is an interdisciplinary field, the incentives of
modern academia can fence researchers into domain-specific silos.
Conference tracks, while useful and even necessary, can reinforce these
silos. **Edge Cases** is a satellite symposium designed to break these
boundaries and highlight the sheer diversity of network science projects
and applications. We focus specifically on interdisciplinary work that
applies computational methods to surprising domains. Our goal is to
convey to attendees how the same graph-theoretical tools can apply
(often quite differently) and reveal very different insights in very
different fields.

Hosted by Wolfram Research, and co-organized with Complexity Coffee (an
independent organization of Santa Fe Institute Complexity Global School
alumni), this event focuses on the novel, the interdisciplinary, and the
computational. We welcome submissions that apply graph theory to
distinct, surprising, or historically non-quantitative subjects.

We invite contributions that broaden the horizons of network science. We
are specifically seeking research that applies computational graph
theory in novel or unexpected ways, prioritizing work that offers fresh
perspectives to attendees regardless of their primary domain expertise.

We welcome research that explores the broad themes of Encoding and
Representation (deriving and representing network structures from
qualitative or abstract data), Evolution and Adaptation (how networks
grow and adapt to selective pressures), Dynamics and Function (how
structural properties influence network processes), and Foundational
Frameworks (for example, using hypergraph approaches to model multi-way
interactions and complex dependencies that cannot be captured by simple
pairwise edges) in network science. 

Our preliminary program already shows this diversity as it features work
on topics ranging from the topology of judicial decisions to conflict
soundscapes, and changemaker networks in the Peruvian Amazon.

## **General details**

- **Duration:** Half-day (4 hours)

- **Speaker Goal:** 8--10 speakers.

- **Proposed Structure:** We are proposing a high-density half-day
  event. To accommodate our target of 8--10 speakers within a 4-hour
  block, we will use a streamlined schedule with strictly timed slots.

## **Proposed Agenda (4 Hours)**

- **Welcome & Introduction (10 mins)**

- **Flagship Talk I (45 mins):** A keynote deep-dive by a senior
  researcher.

- **Talks, Session A (60 mins):** Three 20-minute talks focusing on
  novel applications.

- **Coffee Break & Networking (20 mins)**

- **Flagship Talk II (45 mins):** A second keynote or a featured panel
  discussion.

- **Talks, Session B (60 mins):** Three 20-minute talks.

- **Closing (5 mins)**

**Note:** We are also open to running a full day event if we gather the
appropriate momentum and a large enough lineup of speakers. If the
volume of high-quality responses to our call for speakers exceeds this
capacity, we may consider converting one of the talk sessions into a
\"Lightning Round\" (5 or 10-minute talks) or request a Full-day
extension, but our primary plan is optimized for the Half-day format.
